**Test Case 1: Verify Distinctive Product Pictures (AC1)**

| Step | Action                                                                 | Expected Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Status |
| :--- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----- |
| 1    | Navigate to the Products page (if not already there).                 | The Products page is displayed, showing a list of products.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |        |
| 2    | Observe the product list.                                            |  Each product listed has a visually distinct and identifiable product picture displayed next to its name or description.  The pictures should clearly represent the product and differentiate it from other products in the list. The pictures should be of reasonable size and quality to be easily viewed.                                                                                                                                  |        |
| 3    | Inspect the product pictures for multiple products.                    |  Verify that no two products in the list share the *exact* same product picture. Each picture should be unique to its respective product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |        |
| 4    | Inspect the product pictures for consistency in rendering.           | All pictures should load correctly without any broken image icons. The pictures should be displayed in a consistent manner across all products (e.g., same size, same aspect ratio).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |        |
| 5    | Check responsiveness of Product Pictures (if applicable).            | If the product list is designed to be responsive, verify that product pictures are resized/repositioned appropriately when the browser window is resized or when viewed on different devices (e.g., mobile phones, tablets). The pictures should remain visible and identifiable even on smaller screens.                                                                                                                               |        |
| 6    | Check for alt text on image elements.                                | For each product picture, verify that an `alt` attribute is present on the `<img>` tag. The `alt` text should provide a brief and descriptive text of the product for accessibility and SEO purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |        |

**Test Case 2: Verify Picture Consistency on Product Detail Page (AC2)**

| Step | Action                                                                 | Expected Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Status |
| :--- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----- |
| 1    | On the Products page, identify a specific product and its picture.   | Select a specific product from the list.  Note the picture associated with that product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |        |
| 2    | Click on the selected product (e.g., click on the product name or picture). | The user is navigated to the product detail page for the selected product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |        |
| 3    | Observe the product detail page.                                      | The product detail page displays the selected product's information (name, description, price, etc.).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |        |
| 4    | Verify product picture on detail page.                                 | The product detail page displays the *exact same* picture that was shown on the product list preview. The picture should be of the same size, quality, and appearance.                                                                                                                                                                     |        |
| 5    | Repeat steps 1-4 for multiple products                               | Repeat the process for a few more products in the list to ensure that the picture consistency holds true for all products.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |        |

**Additional Considerations/Notes:**

*   **Error Handling:** If a picture fails to load on the product list, there should be an appropriate placeholder (e.g., a default image icon or a message indicating the image cannot be displayed).
*   **Performance:** The product pictures should load quickly to avoid slowing down the product list page.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure that the product pictures are accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., through appropriate alt text).
*   **Test Environment:** The test should be performed on a stable and reliable testing environment that accurately reflects the production environment.
*   **Browsers:** Test in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
*   **Device Testing:** If the application is designed for mobile devices, test on different devices and screen sizes to ensure the product pictures are displayed correctly.
*   **Negative Testing:**  Consider negative test cases:
    *   What happens if a product doesn't have a picture? (e.g., a default placeholder)
    *   What if the image URL is broken? (e.g., a broken image icon)

This detailed breakdown should help you effectively test the feature. Remember to update the "Status" column in the table above with "Pass", "Fail", or "Blocked" after each step. Good luck!
