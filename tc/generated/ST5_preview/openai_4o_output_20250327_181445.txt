To ensure that the feature of displaying preview pictures on the product list is working correctly, we can design a series of test cases based on the provided acceptance criteria. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Test Case 1: Verify Each Product Has a Distinctive Preview Picture

**Preconditions:**
- User is logged in with the following credentials:
  - Username: `standard_user`
  - Password: `secret_sauce`

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the product list page after logging in.
2. Verify that each product displayed on the list page has a preview picture.

**Expected Result:**
- Each product should have a unique and distinctive preview picture displayed alongside it.

### Test Case 2: Verify Clicking a Product Shows the Same Picture as Preview

**Preconditions:**
- User is logged in with the following credentials:
  - Username: `standard_user`
  - Password: `secret_sauce`

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the product list page after logging in.
2. Select a product from the product list that has a preview picture.
3. Click on the selected product to view the product details page.

**Expected Result:**
- The picture shown on the product details page should be the same as the preview picture displayed on the product list.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Edge Case Testing:**
  - Verify the behavior when there are no products listed (e.g., an empty state should not display any preview picture).
  - Test with different screen resolutions to ensure the preview pictures are correctly displayed and not distorted.

- **Usability Testing:**
  - Ensure that the pictures load quickly and are of high quality.
  - Check that the UI is responsive and that pictures adjust correctly to different screen sizes.

- **Security Testing:**
  - Verify that accessing product details and pictures does not expose any sensitive information through URLs or network requests.

By following these test cases, you can confirm that the feature meets the specified acceptance criteria and provides a seamless experience for users when selecting products based on preview pictures.
