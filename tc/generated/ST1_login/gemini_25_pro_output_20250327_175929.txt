Okay, let's refine this user story and derive test cases from it. The original story is a good start, but we can make the ACs more explicit and cover more edge cases implicitly suggested by the test data and standard login functionality.

**Refined User Story**

*   **ID:** ST_LOGIN
*   **Title:** User Login to Access Product List
*   **As a:** Registered User
*   **I want to:** Log in to the system using my username and password

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   The user has navigated to the application's login page.
    *   Valid user credentials exist: `username: standard_user`, `password: secret_sauce`.

    *   **AC3: Login with Incorrect Username:**
        *   *Given* the user is on the login page
        *   *When* the user enters an incorrect `username` (e.g., `invalid_user`)
        *   *And* the user enters *any* `password` (e.g., `secret_sauce`)
        *   *And* the user clicks the 'Login' button
        *   *Then* the user remains on the login page
        *   *And* an error message is displayed: "Epic sadface: Username and password do not match any user in this service".
    *   **AC4: Login attempt with Empty Username:**
        *   *Given* the user is on the login page
        *   *When* the user leaves the `username` field empty
        *   *And* the user enters *any* `password`

        *   *And* an error message is displayed: "Epic sadface: Username is required". *(Note: Updated error based on actual Saucedemo site)*
    *   **AC5: Login attempt with Empty Password:**
        *   *Given* the user is on the login page
        *   *When* the user enters *any* `username`
        *   *And* the user leaves the `password` field empty
        *   *And* the user clicks the 'Login' button
        *   *Then* the user remains on the login page
        *   *And* an error message is displayed: "Epic sadface: Password is required". *(Note: Updated error based on actual Saucedemo site)*

These refinements provide clearer acceptance criteria and a more comprehensive set of test cases covering the primary login flows (happy path and common error conditions).
