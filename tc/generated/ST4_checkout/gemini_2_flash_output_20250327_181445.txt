    *   **Expected Results:**
        *   User navigates to the "Checkout: Complete!" page (/checkout-complete.html).
        *   Verify the URL in the browser's address bar is /checkout-complete.html.
        *   Verify the page title or a specific element on the page confirms the user is on the "Checkout: Complete!" page.
        *   Verify that a success message is displayed (e.g., "THANK YOU FOR YOUR ORDER").

*   **TC4: Return to Product List and Verify Cart Emptied (AC4)**

    *   **Test Objective:** Verify redirection to the product list page and that the cart is empty.
    *   **Preconditions:**
        *   User is on the "Checkout: Complete!" page (/checkout-complete.html).
        *   User has successfully completed the checkout process.
    *   **Test Steps:**
        1.  Click the "Back Home" button.
    *   **Expected Results:**
        *   User is redirected to the product list page (e.g., /inventory.html or the home page).
        *   The shopping cart is empty (e.g., the cart icon shows "0" items, or the cart page is empty).
        *   Verify there are no items in the cart.
        *   Verify the URL in the browser's address bar is the product list page

**Important Considerations for Testing:**

*   **Test Environment:** Ensure a stable testing environment (e.g., a testing server or a local development environment) that is separate from the production environment.
*   **Test Data:** The provided test data is a good starting point, but consider creating additional test data scenarios, including:
    *   Different combinations of items in the cart.
    *   Different shipping addresses (valid and invalid formats).
    *   Edge cases (e.g., very large order totals, empty cart attempts to checkout).
    *   Test with and without tax.
*   **Automation:** Automating these tests with tools like Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright is highly recommended for regression testing and ensuring the checkout process remains functional after code changes.
*   **Error Handling:** Test how the application handles invalid input (e.g., incorrect postal codes, missing fields).  Ensure that appropriate error messages are displayed to the user.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure the checkout process is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility).
*   **Performance:** Consider performance testing to ensure the checkout process is fast and responsive, especially under heavy load.
*   **Security:**  While not explicitly mentioned, consider security aspects such as protecting sensitive user data (e.g., credit card information) during the checkout process.  This might involve verifying the use of HTTPS and secure payment gateways.
*   **Browser Compatibility:** Test the checkout process in various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure compatibility.
*   **Edge Cases:** Test edge cases, such as what happens if an item is out of stock during checkout.

By following this test plan and considering the additional points, you can thoroughly test the checkout functionality and ensure a smooth and reliable user experience. Remember to document your test results and any issues encountered.
