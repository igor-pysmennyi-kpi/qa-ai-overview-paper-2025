| 3    | Check the shopping cart icon (in the header navigation).                               | The cart icon displays a badge with the number "1", indicating one item added.                                       | AC2                 |
| 4    | Click on the shopping cart icon to navigate to the cart page.                          | User is redirected to the cart page (/cart.html).                                                                    | AC3                 |
