To ensure that the feature for adding an item to the shopping cart directly from the product list works as expected, we can create a series of test scenarios based on the provided acceptance criteria and preconditions. Here's a structured approach to testing the feature:

### Test Scenarios

#### Precondition
- Ensure the user is logged in with the given credentials (username: `standard_user`, password: `secret_sauce`) and is on the inventory page (`/inventory.html`).

#### Test Scenario 1: Verify "Add to cart" Button Visibility (AC1)
1. **Given** the user is on the inventory page.
2. **Then** verify that each product item listed on the page has a visible "Add to cart" button.

#### Test Scenario 2: Add Item to Cart and Update Cart Badge (AC2)
1. **Given** the user is on the inventory page.
2. **When** the user clicks the "Add to cart" button for a specific product.
3. **Then** verify that a single item is added to the shopping cart.
4. **And** check that the shopping cart icon in the header updates to display a badge indicating the total number of items currently in the cart. For example, it should show '1' after adding the first item.

#### Test Scenario 3: View Cart and Verify Added Item (AC3)
1. **Given** a product is added to the shopping cart.
2. **When** the user clicks on the cart icon.
3. **Then** verify that the user is redirected to the shopping cart page.
4. **And** confirm that the selected item is visible in the cart.

### Test Execution Steps

For each scenario, perform the following steps:

1. **Login to the Application:**
   - Navigate to the login page.
   - Enter the username `standard_user` and password `secret_sauce`.
   - Submit the login form.

2. **Navigate to Inventory Page:**
   - Ensure you are redirected to `/inventory.html`.

3. **Execute Test Scenarios:**
   - For **Scenario 1**, visually inspect or use automated checks to ensure the "Add to cart" button is visible for each product.
   - For **Scenario 2**, click the "Add to cart" button for a product and verify the cart badge updates correctly.
   - For **Scenario 3**, click the cart icon and verify that the item is present in the cart.

### Expected Results
- **Scenario 1:** Each product should have a visible "Add to cart" button.
- **Scenario 2:** Clicking "Add to cart" should add one item to the cart, and the cart badge should reflect the correct number of items.
- **Scenario 3:** Clicking the cart icon should take the user to the cart page, where the added item is visible.

By following these test scenarios and steps, you can verify that the feature functions according to the specified acceptance criteria and provides a seamless shopping experience for the user.
