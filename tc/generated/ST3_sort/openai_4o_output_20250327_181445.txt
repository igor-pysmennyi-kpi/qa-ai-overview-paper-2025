To effectively verify the functionality described in the user story, you can create a set of test cases based on the acceptance criteria and other relevant details. Here's a structured approach:

### Test Case 1: Verify Dropdown Options for Sorting

**Preconditions:**
- User is logged in with username `standard_user` and password `secret_sauce`.
- User is on the inventory page (`/inventory.html`).

**Test Steps:**
1. Locate and click on the sort dropdown menu.
2. Observe the options available in the dropdown menu.

**Expected Result:**
- The dropdown contains the options: "Name (A to Z)", "Name (Z to A)", "Price (low to high)", and "Price (high to low)".

### Test Case 2: Sort Products by Price (Low to High)

**Preconditions:**
- User is logged in with username `standard_user` and password `secret_sauce`.
- User is on the inventory page (`/inventory.html`).
- Sort dropdown is visible.

**Test Steps:**
1. Click on the sort dropdown menu.
2. Select the "Price (low to high)" option.
3. Observe the order of products displayed.

**Expected Result:**
- Products are sorted in ascending order of price, with the cheapest product listed first.

### Test Case 3: Sort Products by Price (High to Low)

**Preconditions:**
- User is logged in with username `standard_user` and password `secret_sauce`.
- User is on the inventory page (`/inventory.html`).
- Sort dropdown is visible.

**Test Steps:**
1. Click on the sort dropdown menu.
2. Select the "Price (high to low)" option.
3. Observe the order of products displayed.

**Expected Result:**
- Products are sorted in descending order of price, with the most expensive product listed first.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Error Handling:** Consider testing how the application behaves if there's an issue loading product prices or if the dropdown fails to load.
- **UI/UX:** Verify that the sort feature is intuitive and doesn't disrupt the user experience.
- **Performance:** Ensure that the sorting operation is performed quickly and efficiently, even with a large number of products.
- **Cross-browser Testing:** Verify that the sorting feature works consistently across different web browsers and devices.

By following these detailed test cases, you can ensure that the sorting functionality meets the specified requirements and provides a seamless experience for the user.
